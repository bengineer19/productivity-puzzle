        In 2008, there was a global financial crisis. 
        Almost no part of the modern world was unaffected.
        But after a year or two, though things weren't entirely back to normal, they were pretty close.
        Well, they were for most countries.

        In the UK, producitivity never properly recovered. What's weirder: economists don't really know why.
        It's known as the <strong>Productivity Puzzle</strong>, and this is a quick exploration of it, mostly for my benefit. 
        I wanted to learn how to use <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, and I also wanted to clear my mind by making a project using just Vanilla JS & CSS, no reactivity or UI frameworks.
        I don't know anything about economics at all, so this is just me having a prod around, idk what I'm talking about üôè.
