      The Productivity Puzzle
    </h1>

      <p>

        In 2008, there was a global financial crisis. 
        Almost no part of the modern world was unaffected.
        But after a year or two, though things weren't entirely back to normal, they were pretty close.
        Well, they were for most countries.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, producitivity never properly recovered. What's weirder: economists don't really know why.
        It's known as the <strong>Productivity Puzzle</strong>, and this is a quick exploration of it, mostly for my benefit. 
        I wanted to learn how to use <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, and I also wanted to clear my mind by making a project using just Vanilla JS & CSS, no reactivity or UI frameworks.
        I don't know anything about economics at all, so this is just me having a prod around, idk what I'm talking about üôè.

    <p class="articleText">
      Let's start with comparing the productivity of all the G7 nations. The UK is blue.

    <div id="italyNote"> 
      <p>
        Side note: why is Italy's growth so much smaller than other G7 nations?
        There are a few reasons, but a major one is that Italy's economy is largely dependent on family-run businesses.
        In fact, 95% of Italian businesses have fewer than 10 employees. 
        These small firms find it harder to effectively leverage tech.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="articleText">
      <p>
        It's clear that apart from Italy (which has a visibly smaller growth rate before the crisis anyway), the UK is doing pretty badly compared to other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        First question: what does productivity even mean? Productivity is measured here as GDP per hour worked.
        So here's where it gets even weirder. If we take a look at these metrics in the UK, they were all doing just fine after 2008. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="color: rgb(31, 119, 180)">GDP</span> 
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 127, 14)">Employment</span> 
        <span style="color: rgb(44, 160, 44)">Total hours</span> 
        <span style="color: rgb(219, 39, 40); font-weight: 600;">Productivity</span> 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="articleText">
      <p>
        So that's pretty interesting. Since productivity is GDP / hour worked, and the GDP and hours worked are both rising at a pretty similar rate, the productivity in red stays pretty much constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        So is the problem with GDP being lower than before, or hours worked being higher than before? Here's a graph of UK labour over time

      <p>It's clear that labour grew pretty fast after the crisis - perhaps faster than it was growing before. 
        And though part of that is due to "recovering" the jobs that were lost during the downturn, it's still significant - labour recovered more quickly than output did. 
        It's said that following the recession, some UK firms "hoarded" workers, and so the UK's labour decline during the crisis was in fact not as dramatic as many other countries 
        (source: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/344439/The_Labour_Market_Story-_The_UK_Following_Recession.pdf">UKCES</a>).
      </p>
      <p>This seems strange - you might expect that a country full of firms in demand of work would have an increasing output, especially given the UK's record before the crisis.
        But as we know, productivity remained pretty flat. The fact that labour grew rapidly after the crisis is interesting, but doesn't answer the question alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this is a story of the UK vs other countries, we have to look at what makes the UK economy different to others. 
        There are two relevant answers: the UK Finance sector, and government investment in the economy. 
        Let's talk about the finance sector first.
