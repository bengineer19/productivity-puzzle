      The Productivity Puzzle

        In 2008, there was a global financial crisis. 
        Almost no part of the modern world was unaffected.
        But after a year or two, though things weren't entirely back to normal, they were pretty close.
        Well, they were for most countries.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, producitivity never properly recovered. What's weirder: economists don't really know why.
        It's known as the <strong>Productivity Puzzle</strong>, and this is a quick exploration of it, mostly for my benefit. 
        I wanted to learn how to use <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, and I also wanted to clear my mind by making a project using just Vanilla JS & CSS, no reactivity or UI frameworks.
        I don't know anything about economics at all, so this is just me having a prod around, idk what I'm talking about üôè.

      Let's start with comparing the productivity of all the G7 nations. The UK is blue.

      <p>
        Side note: why is Italy's growth so much smaller than other G7 nations?
        There are a few reasons, but a major one is that Italy's economy is largely dependent on family-run businesses.
        In fact, 95% of Italian businesses have fewer than 10 employees. 
        These small firms find it harder to effectively leverage tech.
      </p>

        It's clear that apart from Italy (which has a visibly smaller growth rate before the crisis anyway), the UK is doing pretty badly compared to other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        First question: what does productivity even mean? Productivity is measured here as GDP per hour worked.
        So here's where it gets even weirder. If we take a look at these metrics in the UK, they were all doing just fine after 2008.

        <span style="color: rgb(31, 119, 180)">GDP</span> 
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 127, 14)">Employment</span> 
        <span style="color: rgb(44, 160, 44)">Total hours</span> 
        <span style="color: rgb(219, 39, 40); font-weight: 600;">Productivity</span> 
      </p>

    <div class="articleText">
      <p>
        So that's pretty interesting. Since productivity is GDP / hour worked, and the GDP and hours worked are both rising at a pretty similar rate, the productivity in red stays pretty much constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        So is the problem with GDP being lower than before, or hours worked being higher than before? Here's a graph of UK labour over time
